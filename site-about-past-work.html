                <h2>about me</h2>
                I originally downloaded roblox studio to create the best game in the first day 
                just like everyone I know. May 2020 I have been obsesed
                with building.
                </br> 
                but around a year later I have noticed that building
                with free models looks bad so I got into modeling July of 2021
                I started of with a donut and got into low-poly. 
                </br>
                then I tried high-poly but shortly realised it's not for me.
                </br>
                later on, roughly July of 2023 I saw a tutorial on youtube
                so I followed it except for scripting since I made my own,
                and then realised vfx is like a blessing from god,
                </br>
                it's so easy to make and looks so good.
                </br>
                Also I have mentiontioned that i created my own script I watch 
                youtube tutorialsfrom time to time so If you have a easy sript 
                for me to make make sure to contact me.
