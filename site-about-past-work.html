                <h2>about me</h2>
                In May of 2020 I downloaded roblox studio. I have obsesed
                over building for couple months then I stoped making games
                for a while everyone has to give up but some people decide 
                to fight through pain and finish their goals.
                </br> 
                when I got back to game development after 2 month break
                I have noticed that buildingwith free models 
                looks bad so I got into modeling in July of 2021
                I started of with a donut and got into low-poly.
                </br>
                then I tried high-poly but shortly realised it's not for me.
                so all I have left after high-poly is my shading skills.
                </br>
                later on, roughly in September of 2023 I saw a vfx tutorial on youtube
                so I followed it except for scripting since I made my own scripts,
                and then realised vfx is like a blessing from god,
                </br>
                it's so easy to make and looks so good, at least in my eyes.
                It is the best way to liven up the game.
                </br>
                Also I have mentiontioned that i created my own script I watch 
                youtube tutorials from time to time so If you have a easy sript 
                for me to write, make sure to contact me.
